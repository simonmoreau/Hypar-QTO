# Concept

This is a generator for the [Hypar](https://www.hypar.io/) platform to generate a building based on an outline. This model can then be used for hight-level quantity takeoff.
The outline is a json file containing levels and polylines to define the outer outline of our building.

# Getting started

To understand how to run this, go look at the [Hypar genarator sample](https://github.com/hypar-io/generator)

# Testing

```
cd test
dotnet test
```

# Built With

* [Hypar's](https://www.hypar.io/) [elements library](https://github.com/hypar-io/elements)
